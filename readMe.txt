Catch the Hatchlings! is a side-scrolling platform game that allows users to navigate through a stage of obstacles. The objective is to explore the stage to find eggs and travel to the flagpole located near the end of the stage. If player is attacked by monsters during the journey, the players will lose points off of the health bar and eventually die when the health bar reaches 0. The player can receive a power up, Wings, which allows the player to jump higher, after retrieving the first egg. The player must utilize the power wisely as it can only be used once. There are a total of three levels and difficulty increases as the player advances. Watch out for those monsters! They gain the ability to jump after the first level. Also take note that one extra platform is added each time the player advances to the next level!
